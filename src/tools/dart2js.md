Use the _dart2js_ tool to compile Dart code to deployable JavaScript.
Another Dart-to-JavaScript compiler, [dartdevc][], is for development use only.
The [build_runner][] tool uses dartdevc by default, but when you're compiling
for production, you can [configure][config] build_runner to use dart2js.

The dart2js tool provides hints for improving your Dart code and removing
unused code.
Also see [dartanalyzer,](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/tree/master/pkg/analyzer_cli#dartanalyzer)
which performs a similar analysis but has a different implementation.

This page tells you how to use dart2js on the command line. It also give tips
on debugging the JavaScript that dart2js generates.

## Basic usage

Here’s an example of compiling a Dart file to JavaScript:

{% prettify terminal %}
$ dart2js --out=test.js test.dart
{% endprettify %}

This command produces a file that contains the JavaScript equivalent of your
Dart code. It also produces a source map, which can help you debug the
JavaScript version of the app more easily.

## Build config usage

You can also configure dart2js options in a build config file.
For more information, see the [build_runner][] section on
[config files](/tools/build_runner#config).

## Options

* [Basic options](#basic-options)
* [Path and environment options](#path-and-environment-options)
* [Display options](#display-options)
* [Analysis options](#analysis-options)
* [Size and speed options](#size-and-speed-options)

#### Basic options

Common command-line options for dart2js include:

`-o <file>` or `--out=<file>`
: Generate the output into `<file>`. If not specified,
  the output goes in a file named `out.js`.

{% comment %}
  See https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/32442

  `-c` or `--checked`
  : Insert runtime type checks, and enable assertions (checked mode).
{% endcomment %}

`--enable-asserts`
: Enable assertion checking.

`-m` or `--minify`
: Generate minified output.

`-h` or `--help`
: Display help. (Use `-vh` for information about all options.)


#### Path and environment options

Some other handy options include:

`--packages=<path>`
: Specify the path to the package resolution configuration file.
  For more information, see
  [Package Resolution Configuration File](https://github.com/lrhn/dep-pkgspec/blob/master/DEP-pkgspec.md).
  _This option cannot be used with `--package-root`._

`-p <path>` or `--package-root=<path>`
: Specify where to find "package:" imports.
  _This option cannot be used with `--packages`._


`-D<flag>=<value>`
: Define an environment variable.

`--version`
: Display version information for dart2js.


#### Display options

The following options help you control the output of dart2js:

`--suppress-warnings`
: Don't display warnings.

`--suppress-hints`
: Don't display hints.

`--terse`
: Emit diagnostics, but don't suggest how to get rid of the diagnosed problems.

`-v` or `--verbose`
: Display lots of information.


#### Analysis options

The following options control the analysis that dart2js performs on Dart code:

`--analyze-all`
: Analyze even the code that isn't reachable from `main()`. This option
  is useful for finding errors in libraries, but using it can result in
  bigger and slower output.

`--analyze-only`
: Analyze the code, but don't generate code.

`--analyze-signatures-only`
: Like `--analyze-only`, but skip analysis of method bodies and field
  initializers.

`--enable-diagnostic-colors`
: Add colors to diagnostic messages.

`--show-package-warnings`
: Show warnings and hints generated from packages.

`--csp`
: If true, disable dynamic generation of code in the generated output.
  This is necessary to satisfy CSP restrictions
  (see [W3C Content Security Policy](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/)).
  The default is false.

`--dump-info`
: Generate a file (with the suffix `.info.json`)
  that contains information about the generated code.
  You can inspect the generated file with the
  [Dump Info Visualizer](https://github.com/dart-lang/dump-info-visualizer).


#### Size and speed options

When you're ready to deploy,
consider using the following options,
in addition to minifying your app's JavaScript.
These options can improve the JavaScript that dart2js provides,
but they have possible downsides.

For more information, see the `--minify` option
(one of the dart2js [basic options](#basic-options)) and the
[Angular deployment guide](/angular/guide/deployment).

`--fast-startup`
: Produce JavaScript that can be parsed more quickly by VMs.
  This option usually results in **larger** JavaScript files
  with **faster** startup.

  <aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Note:** The `--fast-startup` option doesn't support the
  [dart:mirrors library.]({{site.dart_api}}/{{site.data.pkg-vers.SDK.channel}}/dart-mirrors)
  </aside>

`--trust-primitives`
: Assume that operations on numbers, strings, and lists have valid inputs.
  This option allows the compiler to drop runtime checks for those operations.
  A well-typed program is not guaranteed to have valid inputs,
  because (for example) any `int` can be `null`.
  This option often improves both size and speed.<br><br>

  Use this option only if you have enough testing to ensure that
  those checks are not needed;
  otherwise the program will behave unexpectedly.

  For example, with `--trust-primitives` and the code
  `m1(num x, dynamic y) => x + y;`,
  the compiler assumes that `x` is non-null and `y` is a number.
  If those aren't true, then `m1` might return NaN or `'$x$y'`,
  instead of throwing an error.

  As another example, with `--trust-primitives` and the code
  `m2(int x, list y) => y[x];`,
  the compiler assumes that `x` is within range.
  If `x` is negative or too large, `m2` might return null
  instead of throwing an error.

  <aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
  **Warning:** The `--trust-primitives` option can cause incorrect behavior if
  your code doesn't guarantee valid inputs to primitive operations.
  </aside>

`--trust-type-annotations`
: Assume that all types are correct.
  {%- comment %}
    See https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/32442
    Does this still make sense in Dart 2?
  {% endcomment %}
  If the analyzer reports no issues in your code,
  we recommend using this option when deploying your app.
  This option can significantly improve both size and speed.

  <aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
    **Warning:** The `--trust-type-annotations` option can
    result in confusing error messages,
    especially in minified code.
  </aside>


## Helping dart2js generate better code {#helping-dart2js-generate-efficient-code}

You can do a couple of things to improve the code that dart2js generates:

* Write your code in a way that makes type inference easier.
* Once you’re ready to deploy your app, minify it and consider using
  the dart2js [size and speed options](#size-and-speed-options)
  to reduce code size or startup time.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
  **Note:**
  Don’t worry about the size of your app’s included libraries. The dart2js tool
  performs tree shaking to omit unused classes, functions, methods, and so on.
  Just import the libraries you need, and let dart2js get rid of what you don’t
  need.
</aside>

Follow these practices to help dart2js do better type inference, so it can generate smaller and faster JavaScript code:

* Don't use `Function.apply()`.
* Don't override `noSuchMethod()`.
* Avoid setting variables to null.
* Be consistent with the types of arguments you pass into each function or
  method.

## Debugging {#debugging}

This section gives tips for debugging dart2js-produced code in Chrome, Firefox,
and Safari. Debugging the JavaScript produced by dart2js is easiest in
browsers such as Chrome that support source maps.

Whichever browser you use, you should enable pausing on at least
uncaught exceptions, and perhaps on all exceptions. For frameworks such
as dart:async that wrap user code in try-catch, we
recommend pausing on all exceptions.

### Chrome {#dart2js-debugging-chrome}

To debug in Chrome:

1. Open the Developer Tools window, as described in the
   [Chrome DevTools documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/index).
2. Turn on source maps, as described in the video
   [SourceMaps in Chrome](http://bit.ly/YugIUY).
3. Enable debugging, either on all exceptions or only on uncaught exceptions,
   as described in
   [How to set breakpoints](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/debug/breakpoints/add-breakpoints).
4. Reload your app.

### Internet Explorer {#dart2js-debugging-ie}

To debug in Internet Explorer:

1. Update to the latest version of Internet Explorer. (Source-map support
   was added to IE in April 2014).
2. Load **Developer Tools** (**F12**). For more information, see
   [Using the F12 developer tools](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/bg182326(v=vs.85)).
3. Reload the app. The **debugger** tab shows source-mapped files.
4. Exception behavior can be controlled through **Ctrl+Shift+E**;
   the default is **Break on unhandled exceptions**.

### Firefox {#dart2js-debugging-firefox}

Firefox doesn’t yet support source maps (see [bug #771597](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771597)).

To debug in Firefox:

1. Enable the Developer Toolbar, as described in Kevin Dangoor’s blog post,
   <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/08/new-firefox-command-line-helps-you-develop-faster/">New Firefox Command Line Helps You Develop
   Faster"</a>.
   
2. Click <strong>Pause on exceptions</strong>, as shown in the
   following figure.
   <img src="{% asset_path 'ff-debug.png' %}" alt="Firefox Toolbar"><br /><br />
3. Reload your app.


### Safari {#dart2js-debugging-safari}

To debug in Safari:

1. Turn on the Develop menu, as described in the [Safari Web Inspector Tutorial.](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/Web_Inspector_Tutorial/EnableWebInspector/EnableWebInspector.html)
2. Enable breaks, either on all exceptions or only on uncaught exceptions.
   See [Add a JavaScript breakpoint](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/safari-developer/add-a-javascript-breakpoint-dev5e4caf347/mac) under [Safari Developer Help.](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/safari-developer/welcome/mac)
3. Reload your app.
